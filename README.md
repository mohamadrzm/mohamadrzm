Of course, I must say that everything is interesting to me. lol. I am currently working on the lovely react js and next js framework. But I'm also thinking about deeper server learning. If you want to know more about me, I'd be happy to visit [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamadreza-mirjani-7841542b8/) page :)
